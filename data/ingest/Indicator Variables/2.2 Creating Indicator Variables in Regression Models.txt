In this lesson we show how we can create and
use indicator or dummy variables in regression model,
so what should we do about the categorical variable age?
So is this categorical variable important?
Does being middle aged or
old potentially have an effect on amount spent compared to being young?
How can we include the age variable in a regression
model that requires numeric values?
So these are some values of the age variable, so consider that variable,
we want to investigate the effect of age on amount spent,
note that age is a categorical variable.
It has three possible values, young,
middle or old, we need to quantify this variable.
So what we need to do is to create indicator or dummy variables,
since we have three possible values for age,
we need to create two indicator or dummy variables.
The base or reference case, with both dummy variable set to 0, is age = young.
This is the reference group to compare for the other values of the dummy variable.
It's up to the modeler to determine which value of
the categorical variable is used as the base case.
The two dummy variables that we have created are AgeMid and
AgeOld, and AgeMid is set to 1 if the age of a customer is,
if he or she is in the is middled aged.
Zero otherwise, and AgeOld is set to 1 if a customer
is an older person and set to 0 otherwise.
So assigning values to the new indicated variables, so
here is how we're gonna go do it, if you look at the first record,
it is for a customer who's old, so for that customer the AgeMid
callable a value of 0 and age old will have value 1.
The second record is for customer who's middle age for him or
her the AgeMid column A lot of value 1 and the AgeOld is 0.
The third record is of a base case, this is a customer who is young and
for him or her the AgeMid value 0, and the AgeOld value is also set to 0.
So both indicate a variable to set to 0 for someone who is young.
And then we can run the regression model amount spent
equals b0 plus b1 times AgeMid plus b2 times AgeOld.
We'll see that shortly.
Before we go to the next lesson, have a go at this quiz.
With this indicator variables coding scheme, AgeMid and
AgeOld, defined as earlier, can a record in this dataframe
have this value (AgeMid = 0, AgeOld equals = 0)?
The answer is yes, because this record is for
someone who's young, that is the base case.
Can a record in the direct marketing dataframe have
this value, AgeMid = 1, and AgeOld = 1?
The answer is no, every individual has to be inexactly one age category.
So, we've seen how to create indicator dummy variables in this lesson.
