For all the subsequent transcripts that I send, 
1. Assign a Topic Title and make a one line summary of what is being discussed.
2. Student Summary: Make a list of points for a student summary arranged hierarchically by main terms or topics (i.e., nested dictionary). 
3. Related Information: Make a list of points of related information from your knowledge base as of your last training cut-off.

Do not repeat information present in the Student Summary on your related information - rather expand on some similar concepts or provide further details or examples.
Also, be aware to use utf-8 mathematical characters where applicable.

At the end, add:
- Benefits and limitations of the topic.
- Give me a real world and high-stakes example where this content was applicable. What happened? What year was it? Who was involved? Tell it in a story style, and it has to be factual and actually happened
- What is considered to be state of the art research as of your last training cut-off.
- Make a reference to a maximum of three real (i.e., they exist!) published academic papers from journals, with a brief summary of their abstract and the year it was written. Provide me to html link to the reference.

Feel free to use hierarchical bullet points to better organise information.

Do not tell me about your last training cut-off in September 2021 as I already know this.

Do not include any explanations, only provide a  RFC8259 compliant JSON response  following this format without deviation.
